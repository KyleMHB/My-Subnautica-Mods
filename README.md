# Subnautica-Mods
  This is my repository of mods that I have made as well as many that I have adopted that were open source or that I have gotten permission for.
  
  If you are a mod author returning to Subnautica and I have been updating your mod and you would like it removed from this repository then please let me know and it will be done without hesitation.



This repository now uses 4 game folders for the 4 branches of the 2 games
