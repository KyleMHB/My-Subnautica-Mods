# Power Order
This mod allows you to prioritize types of power sources over others. This is a rewrite and revival of the Power Order mod by Pipman3000 made with his permission.

This mod allows you to prioritize types of power sources over others.

Normally, the game uses whichever power source loads in first. For instance, if you have thermal plants connected to your base via power transmitters, power transmitters load in slower than other power sources so the game will never use them first when consuming power. With this mod, you could put transmitters at the top of the list and then no matter what, they will always be used first when consuming power.

The default order is: power transmitters -> solar panels -> thermal plants -> bioreactors -> nuclear reactors. which can be changed in the in-game options menu.

DO NOT ALTER THE CONFIG.JSON FILE IN THE MOD DIRECTORY. USE THE IN-GAME MOD OPTIONS MENU TO ALTER THE SETTINGS!

Modded power sources will show up as they are built or used and then can be configured in the menu and be saved.
